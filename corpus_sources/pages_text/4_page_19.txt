Time‐aligned text and audio in ELAN, showing several levels of interlinearization: intonation units, words, word glosses, parts of
speech, normative sentences, and free translations.
p. 114 Once you have produced time‐aligned transcripts of the recordings, the next step is to further annotate the
transcripts as interlinear glossed text (IGT), adding additional information like morphemic parsing and
glosses of words and morphemes. Interlinearization tools that are tied to a lexical database (Fieldworks and
Toolbox) are advantageous because they lend consistency and speed—entries are constrained to ensure
they are consistent with those already in the database, and as the database grows, interlinearization
becomes more and more automatic. It is essential, however, that the time codes from the time‐aligned
transcript be preserved so that the resulting IGT will still relate to the media. You can choose to bring your
by
fully interlinearized text back into your time‐aligned transcript (in essence making a ‘round trip’ with the University
p. 115 data), or not. Fig. 4.10 shows a transcript that was time‐aligned in ELAN, then exported to Fieldworks for
interlinearization, and then reimported into ELAN, taking advantage of ELAN's hierarchical tier structure
of
for establishing parent–child relationships between the levels of IGT (see Berez 2007; Hellwig and Van Washington
Uytvanck 2007).
