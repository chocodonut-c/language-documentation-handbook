15.5.3 Transient phenomena: comets and meteor showers, satellites, eclipses
Comets are transient celestial phenomena in that they are not seen in the night sky every year. As comets
get closer to the Sun, their tails get longer, and as they move away from the Sun, their tails get shorter.
Whether approaching or retreating, comets tails always point away from the Sun. A comet can be visible in
the night sky for several months, but usually only a few comets appear during one lifetime. We are fortunate
to have seen three amazing comets in the Northern Hemisphere in the recent past: Halley in 1986,
Hayakutake in 1996, and Hale–Bopp in 1997. People should remember these comets along with Comet

The normal rate for shooting stars is around one every ten minutes; this rate increases during meteor
showers. Meteor showers occur when the Earth passes through the debris left by a comet. Meteor showers
occur several times a year, but they vary in the rate of ‘shooting stars’. The Orionids which occur in October
(see Table 15.3) have a rate of up to twenty‐three meteors per hour.
